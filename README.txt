## Program Details ##

This program will allow you to enter first the name of a text file, then some text to put in that file, then a time indication to schedule
when to make that change. The time input is in "military time" (aka 24-hour) time format, due to being easier to process automatically.
I can also make one using 12-hour format, but I just didn't for this because it's a demo, and demo programs are not meant to be extra advanced.
Also, the default working directory of this program (for the purposes of writing files) is the same directory as where this program itself
is stored. If there is no file by the name you entered to be found within that directory, it will create one for you instead.
Otherwise, it will overwrite the pre-existing file. Please be careful as to not enter the name or file path of a file that is important to you,
as this program is not equiped with a way to undo mistakes made with it. Also, if you enter a time that has already passed today into this
program, the scheduled action will happen immediately, due to it's current-day scheduling setup (I can make one that can schedule for later
days though).

## Disclaimer ##

This program is a demo. While I am able to create software that actually has real world value, that is not what this one is for.
This program is strictly intended to serve as a way for me to showcase my skills as a software developer. Due to the fact how I am self-taught,
I am not able to provide any credentials/certifications that would need to be obtained from a third party, so I hope you will
accept this instead.
