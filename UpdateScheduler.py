"""
This program will collect a time value from the user, as well as details about a file update to happen at said time, then makes sure the scheduled action happens when due.
This is just beginning to tap into my full potential as a software developer. While this may look somewhat basic,
it is important to note that this is just scratching the surface of what I am capable of. More advanced and adaptable versions of this and many other kinds of programs can be created using the skills I have.

DISCLAIMER: This program is a DEMO PROGRAM, one I created for the express purpose of giving others a taste of what I am capable of with my computer programming skills.
I do not intend for it to be useful for any real world purpose, and I advise that you don't expect that from it either.

README: For more info about what this program does, and to learn about it's licencing restrictions, please refer to the README.txt file that is packaged with this one

To run this program on your own device, you will need a working instance of a Python interpreter on that device. This is due to the fact that Python is an interpreted language, rather than compiled,
so it normally cannot be ran entirely on it's own, as it is dependant on another program to enterpret it's code and execute it.
